# LazyFooSDL2inC
A rewrite of the Lazy Foo SDL2 tutorials in plain C

Based entirely on the excellent tutorials at http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php

I've attempted to rewrite these tutorials in an attempt to learn C. The C present here is not "best practice" or even "good".
I'm not a C programmer or a programmer of anything really, and I've made design descisions purely to try things out. There's a lot of pointless malloc'ing and file division, so just use what you want within the terms of LazyFoo. (Apologies if this is breaking those same terms...)
